Git Commands

'git status' (Used to check the status of the local repository like any changes to commit, untracked files, staged files ready to be committed)
'git add <file>...' (Used to add the modified file to staging area ready to be committed)
'git commit -m <file>...' (Used to commit the changes to local repository from where it can be pushed to remote repository, Github)
'git diff --staged' (This will give the changes in the staged area)
'git push -u origin master' (This will push the changes committed to the remote repository)
'git diff --staged --no-renames' (If we are checking changes in multiple files, then this command tells git to treat them seperately, otherwise git thinks that one 
								  file is renamed for other)
'git diff' (This command will show the difference in file that is not in staging area)
